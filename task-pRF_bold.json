 "TaskName": "spatio-tactile population receptive field (pRF) mapping",
 "TaskDescription": "In any given run, participants sensed a row of vibrotactile pinsmoving along cardinal axes over a portion of the fingertip interspersedwith baseline (rest) periods. The pins oscillated according to a sine wavewith alternating on and off periods. Participants were required to countbrief changes in the frequency of the sine wave during each run."
